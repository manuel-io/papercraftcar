This is the software for a papercraft car based on the ATmega8
initially.

### Features:

* Automatic light system
* Forward ultrasonic radar
* Inertial navigation system
* Serial debug output
* In-system programming

### Future improvements:

CAN bus or I2C bus to exchange information between all the car
components. A more robust and good looking design. The posibility
to give wireless instuctions. All this this will increase the size of
the car too.
